# Spatial AI Interface

A spatial-first AI interface where drawing replaces traditional text prompting.

Users express intent visually through sketches, layouts, annotations, and spatial relationships on an infinite canvas. The system interprets this intent using AI and dynamically generates interactive interfaces, dashboards, workflows, and applications directly from the canvas.

Instead of forcing users to describe ideas linearly through text, Spatial AI Interface enables direct visual thinking and real-time human-AI collaboration.

# Installation

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

---

# Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

---

# Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

python -m venv venv
```

## Activate Virtual Environment

### macOS / Linux

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Windows

```bash
venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

---

## Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv requests pydantic websockets
```

---

# Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside:

```txt
backend/
```

Add:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
```

---

# Ollama Setup

Install Ollama and pull a model locally.

Example:

```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

Start Ollama locally before running the backend.

---

# Running the Project

## Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Backend runs on:

```txt
http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Start Frontend

Open a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on:

```txt
http://localhost:5173
```

# MVP Workflow

1. Draw layouts and structures on the canvas
2. Serialize spatial intent
3. Send canvas state to backend
4. Route request through AI orchestration layer
5. Generate structured interface output
6. Render generated interface dynamically

The implemented MVP also includes a deterministic local generation fallback.
That means the browser interface works without a Groq key or a running Ollama
instance. Add credentials in `backend/.env` when you want external AI routing.

# Architecture Overview

## Spatial Canvas

The canvas acts as the primary intent surface.

Users communicate through:

* drawings
* layouts
* text
* positioning
* relationships
* spatial grouping

---

## AI Orchestration

The backend routes tasks between:

* Groq for fast structured generation
* Ollama for local reasoning and routing

The orchestration layer:

* extracts intent
* classifies tasks
* selects tools
* generates structured outputs
* returns renderable interface definitions

---

## Frontend Rendering

Generated outputs are rendered dynamically as:

* interactive interfaces
* dashboards
* components
* workflows
* visual systems

The frontend acts as a spatial runtime for generated applications.

---

# Future Goals

* Incremental regeneration
* Real-time collaborative AI editing
* Multimodal vision understanding
* Selective region updates
* Dynamic tool creation
* Spatial memory systems
* Adaptive generated interfaces
* Local-first AI execution
* Advanced scene graph reasoning

---

# Philosophy

Traditional software forces humans to adapt to tools.

Spatial AI Interface reverses this relationship.

The interface adapts to human intent.

Drawing becomes the native language for interacting with intelligence.
